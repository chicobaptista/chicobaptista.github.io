# Project management stuff:

    Use labels "Parent task" and "Subtask", colored dark purple and light purple.
        This lets me mentally organize the tickets at a glance.
    Task titles
        Put the "Parent task: " in the title of parents
        Put "(Parent #34)" in front of the title of subtasks
        This lets me quickly filter out everything but a parent and its subtasks by simply typing "34)
    List the subtasks in the description of a parent task, such as "Subtasks: #3, #4, #5"
   Create a node diagram showing the relationships between tickets for some hairier parent/sub tasks.
