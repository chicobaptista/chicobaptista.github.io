Hi there!
My name is Francisco Llamosas Baptista.

I'm a software developer passionate about technology and the transformational opportunities it offers. Curious by nature, I've ended up developing an enthusiam for the transdisciplinary approach to problem solving. I have been studying the theory and practice of blockchain technologies for a few years, because I deeply believe in their potential to bring more security, privacy and governance in our day-to-day digital activities.

Professionally, I have applied my knowledge and skills to gain scalability and security in the transmission and storage of data, through the use of the Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Corda blockchain technologies. I also have some side personal projects, one of which aims to leverage the decentralized and immutable nature of the blockchain for the certification, training and continuous improvement of education professionals.

My first degree was on Biological Sciences, and it gave me the opportunity to learn important skills and knowledge, such as analytical-scientific thinking, research methodologies and project development, which have greatly contributed (and still do) to the structure and design of my code, aiming at legibility, maintenance, organization and efficiency.
